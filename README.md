## The Mission

Here the mission is to fix the code "experimental.php". In this code there are a lot of mistakes. 
For this I look at some article like :

-[Jason McCreary on writing clean code](https://dev.to/gonedark/writing-clean-code)
-[PSR2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).

And for a better and more clear vision of the code, I create a new PHP files and rewrite the code in.
